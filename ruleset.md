    ** do not add global css class outside of app.css.
    ** do not use hight periorty selectors outside of index.css.
    ** try to use meaningfull comments over the functions and at the top of the components you create.
    ** isolate the blocks in the components as much as you can by diviving the components to small blocks and make reusable.
    ** all the helper functions will be placed in the utiles folder.
    ** do not delete files just write ate the top for the fill this need to be deleted.
